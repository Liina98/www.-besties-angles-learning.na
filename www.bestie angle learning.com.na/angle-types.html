        <h2>Angle Types in Parallel Lines</h2>
        <p>When dealing with parallel lines, various types of angles come into play. Understanding these angle types is fundamental in geometry. Let's explore four main angle types: alternate interior and exterior angles, corresponding angles, supplementary angles, and vertical angles.</p>
    
        <div class="angle-type">
            <h3>Alternate Interior and Exterior Angles</h3>
            <img src="./assets/z lightning.jpg" alt="Alternate Interior and Exterior Angles" />
            <p>Alternate interior angles are the pairs of angles formed on opposite sides of the transversal and between the parallel lines. Alternate exterior angles are the pairs of angles formed on opposite sides of the transversal but outside the parallel lines. They both formed upa 'Z' patterns like in lightning  where alternate interior angles are created between the lightning bolts and the ground.</p>
               </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="angle-type">
            <h3>Corresponding Angles</h3>
            <img src="./assets/coree road.png" alt="Corresponding Angles" />
            <p>Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of a transversal and parallel lines. They are found in matching corners or positions. For example they  can be found in the "X" shape formed by two pairs of corresponding angles when two streets intersect</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="angle-type">
            <h3>Supplementary Angles</h3>
            <img src="./assets/supp pizza.gif" alt="Supplementary Angles" width="390" height="300"/>
            <p>Supplementary angles are pairs of angles that add up to 180 degrees. When a transversal crosses parallel lines, certain pairs of angles are supplementary.  When the hands on a clock show 3:00, they form supplementary angles, as they are 90 degrees apart.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="angle-type">
            <h3>Vertical Angles</h3>
            <img src="./assets/vert okakonde.jpg" alt="Vertical Angles" width="390" height="300" />
            <p>Vertical angles are formed when two lines intersect. They are always congruent (equal) and share a common vertex but no common sides. An example can be seen in the shape of an "X" created by two intersecting roads. The angles at the intersections are vertical angles and are always congruent</p>
