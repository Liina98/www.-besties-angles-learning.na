        <h2>Understanding Parallel Lines</h2>
        <p>Parallel lines are an essential concept when it comes to understanding angles. They play a key role in various geometric properties. Let's explore what parallel lines are and their significance in real-life situations.</p>
    
        <h3>What Are Parallel Lines?</h3>
        <p>Parallel lines are two or more straight lines that run in the same direction and never intersect. They remain equidistant from each other at all points. In geometric notation, parallel lines are often denoted with double vertical bars (||).</p>
    
        <h3>Real-Life Examples</h3>
        <p>Parallel lines can be found in many aspects of our everyday lives. Here are some visual aids to help you understand parallel lines:</p>

            <p>Railway tracks provide a classic example of parallel lines. The tracks run in the same direction and maintain a constant distance between them.</p>

            <p>Road markings on highways are another instance of parallel lines. They help guide traffic and maintain lane separation.</p>
